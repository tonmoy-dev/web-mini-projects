          What is the difference between let and var in JavaScript?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The main difference between var and let is the scope in which they are
          defined. Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means
          they are only accessible within the function they were declared in, or
          globally if they were declared outside of a function. On the other
          hand, variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they
          are only accessible within the block they were declared in. Another
          difference between var and let is hoisting. Variables declared with
          var are hoisted to the top of the scope and are initialized with the
          value undefined. This means that you can access a variable declared
          with var before it is actually defined in the code. On the other hand,
          variables declared with let are not hoisted and will throw a
          ReferenceError if you try to access them before they are defined.

          What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          In JavaScript, == and === are comparison operators that are used to
          compare values for equality. However, they behave slightly differently
          when comparing values. == is known as the equality operator and will
          perform type coercion if necessary. This means that if you compare
          values of different types, JavaScript will attempt to convert one of
          the values to match the type of the other value before making the
          comparison. On the other hand, === is known as the strict equality
          operator, which compares both the value and the type of the two
          operands. This means that if you compare values of different types,
          the comparison will always return false. In general, it is recommended
          to use === for equality comparisons, because it can prevent unexpected
          behavior due to type coercion.

          How to implement hoisting concept in javascript?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          In JavaScript, hoisting is the behavior of moving variable and
          function declarations to the top of the scope before the code is
          executed. This means that variables and functions declared with the
          var keyword are processed before any code is executed, and are
          therefore accessible throughout the entire scope.
